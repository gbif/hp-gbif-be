### What is GBIF?

GBIF—the **Global Biodiversity Information Facility**—is an international network and data infrastructure funded by the world's governments and aimed at providing anyone, anywhere, open access to data about all types of life on Earth.

### What is this Hosted Portal?

Each **hosted portal** is a simple website hosted and maintained on the GBIF infrastructure. The programme complements other tools available through the network by lowering the technical threshold for maintaining a branded web presence displaying a targeted subset of the data and information already available through GBIF.org. see [GBIF Hosted portals](https://www.gbif.org/hosted-portals) for more

### What is GBIF Node?

The GBIF Node is a team designated by a participant to coordinate a network of people and institutions that produce, manage and use biodiversity data, collectively building an infrastructure for delivering biodiversity information.

### What can I discover on GBIF.be Hosted Portal?

Most of these data are coming from **Belgian Institutions, Public agencies, Scientists and Citizens**, but also from abroad thanks to data repatriation.
