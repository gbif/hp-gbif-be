# Belgium joined the pilot phase of the Metabarcoding Data Programme

The Belgian node joined the [Metabarcoding Data Programme](https://www.gbif.org/metabarcoding), intended to improve GBIFâ€™s integration of DNA metabarcoding data on biodiversity.
As in part a response to the ongoing effort to enrich the GBIF data model, the programme establishes a framework for GBIF nodes to support and engage communities of researchers who collect and manage such evidence using a newly developed tool, the Metabarcoding Data Toolkit (MDT).
**Metabarcoding Data Toolkit** to play a central role in strengthening engagement with researchers and streamlining delivery of DNA-derived data on biodiversity.

[Flanders Research Institute for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (ILVO)](https://www.gbif.org/publisher/ac07bb5e-8a5c-493f-b183-9d7ad8d54cff) recently published three datasets using this tool.
