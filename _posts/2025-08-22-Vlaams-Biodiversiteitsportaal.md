The [**Flemish Biodiversity Portal**](https://natuurdata.inbo.be) (Vlaams Biodiversiteitsportaal, VBP) is the new gateway for biodiversity data in Flanders.
Built on [Atlas of Living Australia (ALA)](https://living-atlases.gbif.org) technology and powered by GBIF data, it integrates information from research, monitoring programs, and citizen science, together with species lists and GIS layers.
The portal is designed to serve both policy and science: it delivers reliable evidence to support biodiversity and environmental policy, while offering scientists standardized, open-access datasets for analysis and international collaboration. 
By linking Flemish data with global infrastructures, the portal demonstrates how open data can strengthen the knowledge base needed to understand, manage, and protect biodiversity.
