[**BIOGEOnet**](https://www.biogeonet.ulg.ac.be/) is the taxonomic and biogeographical database for all living beings, hosted by the BEC Laboratory (Biology, Evolution, Conservation) at the University of Liège.

The database contains millions of biological observations made by various working groups coming from the academic, public, independent and associative sectors (Université de Liège, DNF, Natagriwal, etc.).

Already engaged in the OPEN DATA adventure with GBIF for several years, the commitment accelerated in 2025 with the publication of new datasets, but also by automating existing data flows, enabling access to the most recent BiOGEOnet observations to the GBIF community.

BIOGEOnet services now provides regular observation data updates for

*  [Natagriwal ; Observations made from operations within Natura 2000 habitats and other semi-natural areas](https://www.gbif.org/dataset/ea410929-015a-4093-9c7e-7be2482668c9)
*  [ULG Plantae - Fungi](https://www.gbif.org/dataset/530c309d-0bd0-42d8-8b9e-55fe0f4d918d)
*  [SPW ARNE-DNF : Occurrences of introduced species along roadsides in Wallonia](https://www.gbif.org/dataset/93dc0e04-f4f8-4773-ab23-4fa48327fe2e)
*  [BIOGEOnet : Bryophytes occurrences in Wallonia](https://www.gbif.org/dataset/a76f8527-23e8-4ba5-bdff-f9821bdac187)

and stands as one of the main open biodiversity data provider for the Wallonia !!
