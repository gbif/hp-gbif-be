We are delighted to announce the launching of **GBIF.be**, our Hosted Portal.

Based on a simple website hosted and maintained on the GBIF infrastructure, we customized it to shwocase **biodiversity in Belgium** and the Belgian contribution to GBIF global initiative. Our website is available in three languages : dutch, english and french.

We hope you enjoy it and welcome your comments to make it even more attractive.
