We are delighted to announce the launching of **GBIF.be**, our Hosted Portal.

![GBIF.be](/assets/images/logos/gbif-be-logo.png)

Based on [Hosted portals technology](https://www.gbif.org/hosted-portals) and maintained on the GBIF infrastructure, this website was crafted by the IT team to showcase **biodiversity in Belgium** as our contribution to GBIF global initiative. GBIF.be Hosted portal offers a better visibility for Belgian biodiversity actors and local news. It is available in three languages : dutch, english and french.

We hope you enjoy it and welcome your suggestions for improvements via [GitHub](https://github.com/gbif/hp-gbif-be).
